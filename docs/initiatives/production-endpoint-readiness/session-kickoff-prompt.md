Do not scan unrelated backend plans, initiatives, sessions, or raw docs. Read only:
1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/canonical/SUMMARY.md`
3. `backend/docs/HANDOFF.md`
4. `backend/docs/plans/2026-05-07-production-endpoint-readiness.md`
5. `backend/docs/initiatives/production-endpoint-readiness/tracker.md`
6. active epic named above
7. latest session log named above
8. source files needed for active slice only.

Work one bounded slice only: end-to-end production smoke.

Slice 2 scope:
- Add or extend e2e smoke covering market load, quote, tx/projector indexing, portfolio refresh, and no mock data.
- Run full verification commands from the plan or document exact blockers.
- Add final API impact summary to tracker if epic completes.

Before marking slice done:
- Check `docs/canonical/backend-architecture.md` and backend architecture docs only for relevant changes.
- If API behavior/source labels changed, update `docs/canonical/api-contract.md`.
- Record either exact docs updated or `Architecture docs checked; no update needed`.
- Update tracker slice log, active slice, and this session kickoff prompt.
- Write session log under `backend/docs/initiatives/production-endpoint-readiness/sessions/`.

Completion report must include:
- files changed
- docs changed
- API impact for FE
- verification run
- remaining risks
- next step
```
